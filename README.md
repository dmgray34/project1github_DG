Website to store and search through your favorite recipes.

I have discovered a recent love for cooking, unfortunately I am not very good. I have to follow recipes to the letter and even then I don't always get them right. So I want to create a website where I can store all of my favorite recipes and then be able to search and filter through them based on dish name, ingredients, etc. Right now I have hardcoded one dish in but ideally I want to create webpages dynamically from recipes stored in my database.

Future Features I would like to add:
* Login/Register function
* Save feature for recipes
* Dynamically create webpages based off each dish saved in my database
* Search function by recipe name or by ingredients
* Filterable by ingredients, need a full list of each ingredient used in every recipe added, might be tough
* Maybe filterable by user approval/addition? If multiple users
* Front page have top recipes, updates as change if using user votes?
* Automatically add recipe info by inputting the website, akin to apa citation generator? Might be hard with so many different formats from each recipe website
* When on recipe page:
  * Multiplier for amount needed
  * Up/down votes?
  * Clickable ingredients to cross out when used?
